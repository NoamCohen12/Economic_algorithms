# üßÆ Competitive Equilibrium Model (Logarithmic Utilities)

This project implements a **logarithmic utility-based competitive equilibrium algorithm** in Python using the `cvxpy` optimization library.

The goal is to allocate limited resources to multiple players, each with their own preferences and budgets, in a way that maximizes the **sum of weighted log utilities**. The result reflects both **efficiency** and **fairness**.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

Make sure you have `cvxpy` installed:

```bash
pip install cvxpy
```

Then run the script:

```bash
python algo_EX3.py
```

## üß† Notes

- The algorithm solves a convex optimization problem using `cvxpy`.
- Prices are derived from the dual variables of the supply constraints.
- Utilities are calculated as the sum of allocated value per player.
- Each scenario tests different market dynamics: competition, equality, dominance, and fairness.
