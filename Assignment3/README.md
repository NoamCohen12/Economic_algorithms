# Competitive Equilibrium - Logarithmic Utility Model

This project computes **competitive equilibrium** in a market with multiple players and resources using a **budget-weighted logarithmic utility function**.  
The results below show allocation matrices, equilibrium prices, and utilities for several scenarios.

## âœ… Example 1 - Original

**Allocation Matrix (Players Ã— Resources):**

      R 1  R 2  R 3
Player 1 : 1.00 0.00 0.00 Player 2 : 0.00 1.00 0.06 Player 3 : 0.00 0.00 0.94

**Resource Prices:**
- Resource 1: 59.9996  
- Resource 2: 38.1816  
- Resource 3: 31.8180

**Utility per Player:**
- Player 1: 8.0000  
- Player 2: 6.2857  
- Player 3: 6.6000

## âœ… Example 2 - Distinct Preferences

Each player strongly prefers a different resource.

**Allocation Matrix:**
Player 1 : 1.00 0.00 0.00 Player 2 : 0.00 1.00 0.00 Player 3 : 0.00 0.00 1.00

yaml
Copy
Edit

**Prices:** 60.0000, 39.9999, 30.0001  
**Utilities:** 10.0000, 9.0000, 10.0000

---

## âœ… Example 3 - Overlapping Preferences

All players want similar resources, leading to high prices.

**Allocation Matrix:**
Player 1 : 1.00 0.00 0.00 Player 2 : 0.00 1.00 0.00 Player 3 : 0.00 0.00 1.00

yaml
Copy
Edit

**Prices:** 100.0000, 99.9996, 99.9997  
**Utilities:** 5.0000, 4.0000, 5.0000

---

## âœ… Example 4 - Wealthy Player

Player 1 has much more budget than the others.

**Allocation Matrix:**
Player 1 : 1.00 0.50 0.50 Player 2 : 0.00 0.50 0.00 Player 3 : 0.00 0.00 0.50

yaml
Copy
Edit

**Prices:** 99.9998, 99.9996, 100.0000  
**Utilities:** 12.0000, 2.5000, 4.0000

---

## âœ… Example 5 - Identical Preferences

All players have equal valuations, but different budgets.

**Allocation Matrix:**
Player 1 : 0.30 0.30 0.30 Player 2 : 0.40 0.40 0.40 Player 3 : 0.30 0.30 0.30

yaml
Copy
Edit

**Prices:** 33.3334, 33.3334, 33.3334  
**Utilities:** 4.5000, 5.9999, 4.5000

### ðŸ§  Notes

- Utilities are based on `âˆ‘ value Ã— allocation` per player.
- Prices are derived from dual variables of the resource constraints.
- Each scenario demonstrates a different economic behavior: competition, fairness, domination, etc.
