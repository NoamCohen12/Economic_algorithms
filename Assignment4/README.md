## üß™ Test Case Examples

The code includes built-in test cases to validate the correctness of the algorithm.

### ‚úÖ Test Case 1: 3 Parties, 10 Seats

**Input:**

```python
votes = {"A": 100, "B": 200, "C": 300}
total_seats = 10
```

**Expected Output:**

```python
{"A": 2, "B": 3, "C": 5}
```

---

### ‚úÖ Test Case 2: One party with very few votes

**Input:**

```python
votes = {"A": 100, "B": 200, "C": 1}
total_seats = 10
```

**Expected Output:**

```python
{"A": 3, "B": 6, "C": 1}
```

---

### ‚úÖ Test Case 3: One dominant party

**Input:**

```python
votes = {"A": 100, "B": 200, "C": 10000}
total_seats = 10
```

**Expected Output:**

```python
{"A": 1, "B": 1, "C": 8}
```

---

### ‚úÖ Test Case 4: Two parties with a small vote difference

**Input:**

```python
votes = {"A": 100, "B": 101}
total_seats = 6
```

**Expected Output:**

```python
{"A": 3, "B": 3}
```

---

### ‚úÖ Test Case 5: Party A has twice the votes of Party B

**Input:**

```python
votes = {"A": 100, "B": 50}
total_seats = 6
```

**Expected Output:**

```python
{"A": 4, "B": 2}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3.10+ installed.
2. Run the script using:

```bash
python algo_EX4
```

This will:
- Perform seat allocation using real election data
- Print the difference between original and new seat distribution
- Run 5 test cases and validate correctness using assertions

---

## üìñ Method Summary

The Huntington‚ÄìHill method allocates seats using the formula:

```
priority = votes / sqrt(seats * (seats + 1))
```

All parties start with 1 seat to avoid division by zero.  
Remaining seats are distributed one-by-one to the party with the highest priority score.
